This project analyses electricity consumption over a period of about 14 years.  
Dataset used: **PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data** (Kaggle)  

Several analyses were performed.
1. Daily electricity consumption was visualised 
2. Monthly electricity consumption was visualised
3. ACF plot of monthly electricty consumption was plotted to check seasonality
4. Monthly electricity consumption trends in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were compared
5. Monthly electricity consumption was decomposed into three components (seasonal, trend and residual)
6. Four different models were built using ARIMA, SARIMAX, Exponential Smoothing and RNN
7. Consumption for the next 24 months was forecast using the model based on exponential smoothing. This was the model that gave the best results
